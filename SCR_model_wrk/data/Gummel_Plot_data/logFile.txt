DC DC1[1] <SCR_model_lib:Gummel-Plot:schematic>   X=(0->1)
................................................................................................Warning detected by hpeesofsim during DC analysis `DC1'.
    Circuit converged with at least one device's P-N junction current
            exceeding the explosion current and junction has been linearized.
            You may want to increase the explosion current in the device model or in
            the Options (if the parameter is not given in the model) and resimulate.
            You may need to increase Maximum number of warnings under Output tab
            in Options to see which devices have been linearized.
